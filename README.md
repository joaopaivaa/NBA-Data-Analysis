Repository for all my projects related to NBA:

2024-25 NBA Data Analysis - Quick exploratory data analysis of the actual season leaders in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.

NBA Datasets - Every time the Report Maker is executed in a day, it exports the season stats in that date and saves it in this paste (updated on kaggle monthly).

NBA Report Maker (On going) - Application that receives a player name as input and exports a report about him in a PDF file as output.
